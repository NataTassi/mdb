1
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,772
New York City.

2
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,106
He wants to see what's there.

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,905
I can tell him what's there.

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,451
I don't know <i>how,</i>
when you've never been.

5
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,801
Well, <i>Toto,</i> I guess
we're not in Kansas any more.

6
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,553
I can't figure out why he'd want to go
to New York when we got everything here.

7
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,772
Somethin' I <i>have</i> to do, Dad.

8
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,441
Did you pack an iron
like I told you to?

9
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,642
Mom.

10
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,900
You're gonna walk around
wrinkled in New York if you don't.

11
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,734
Elmer Whitfield's cousin Carlton
went off to New York a normal boy.

12
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,411
Came back with his head shaved
and an earring stuck in his cheek.

13
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,493
Mom, there's
a whole world out there.

14
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,118
I mean big, exciting.

15
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,536
I got a nice,
small apartment lined up.

16
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,869
I got a great job.

17
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,295
I wanna make lots of money.

18
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,417
I want to have a meaningful experience
with an incredibly beautiful woman.

19
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,632
I can't even take a woman like that
to a small apartment.

20
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,214
- I gotta get a penthouse.
- A penthouse?

21
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,262
With a Jacuzzi in it.

22
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,262
Doin' this for you
as much <i>as</i> for me, Mom.

23
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,395
All those years of college...
They're gonna start payin' off.

24
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,035
Back!

25
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,224
All right, listen up.

26
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,648
If there are any bugs in here or rats or
anything that has more legs than I do...

27
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,602
you just stay on your side
of the <i>room,</i> okay?

28
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,686
I'll stay on mine.

29
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,524
I should warn you.
I'm packing an iron.

30
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,411
You weren't listening.

31
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,509
Darling, please pack it
as fast as you can.

32
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,057
- Mr Forbush?
- Not me! He's two <i>doors</i> down the hall.

33
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:05,272
Into the shredder
<i>as</i> fast as possible.

34
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,479
- Mr Forbush.
- Yep.

35
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,485
Hi, I'm Brantley Foster
from Kansas.

36
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,613
- You hired me. I start work here today.
- You're fired, kid. Sorry.

37
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,286
We all saw it coming, but <i>we</i>
looked for some kind of miracle.

38
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,955
Miracle never happened.

39
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,990
- What did happen?
- Hostile takeover.

40
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,918
Ninety percent of the people
in this building are out on the street.

41
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,588
You are one of those 90%%.
Tough break.

42
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,757
Mr Forbush, I was counting on this job.
What do I do now?

43
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,096
Punt!

44
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,516
Okay, New York...

45
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,144
if this is the way
you want it, okay.

46
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,478
- I'm sorry, Mister...
- Foster.

47
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,614
I'm sorry, Mr Foster.
We need someone with experience.

48
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,944
But how can I get experience until
I get a job that gives me experience?

49
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,197
If we gave you a job
just to give you experience...

50
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:04,948
you'd take that experience
and get a betterjob.

51
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,369
Then that experience
would benefit someone else.

52
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,371
But I was trained in college
to handle a job like this.

53
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,548
So in a sense,
I already have experience.

54
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,500
What you've got is
college experience...

55
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,054
not the practical, hard-nosed business
experience we're looking for.

56
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,474
If you'd joined our training program out
of high school, you'd be qualified now.

57
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,392
Then why did I go to college?

58
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,477
Had fun, didn't you?

59
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,566
What impresses me most...

60
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,316
is the amount of experience you picked
up while still attending college.

61
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,448
Well, ma'am, I knew all
those years of college...

62
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:42,118
would be worthless without practical,
hard-nosed business experience.

63
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,413
"Assistant personnel manager,
J. Hall Communications."

64
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,662
Junior purchasing agent,
Midland Furniture.

65
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,791
"Vice President in Charge of
Production, Central Manufacturing."

66
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,248
Outstanding.

67
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,423
You're not gonna tell me I have
too much experience, are you?

68
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,925
Certainly not.
You're perfect for the job.

69
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,552
- Great!
- Except...

70
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,976
No. No exceptions.

71
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,385
I want this job.
I need it. I can do it.

72
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,605
Everywhere I've been today
there's been something wrong.

73
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,978
Too young, too old,
too short, too tall.

74
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,143
Whatever the exception is,
I can fix it.

75
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,729
I can be older. I can be taller.
I can be anything.

76
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,906
Can you be a minority <i>woman?</i>

77
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,954
- <i>Mom, I'm</i> doin' <i>great.</i>
- <i>Is it dirty? Are the people rude?</i>

78
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,703
No, this town is terrific.
The people are really nice.

79
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,286
- <i>That's good. What about your job?</i>
- Job? <i>Hey!</i>

80
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,956
I got a fantastic office,
got a gorgeous secretary. The works.

81
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,713
<i>We don't care if she's gorgeous.
Is she any good?</i>

82
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,677
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>You heard me. Can she type?</i>

83
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,551
Ma, of course she can type.

84
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,305
<i>Some can't, you know. Is it safe there?
You haven't been robbed?</i>

85
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,479
Ma, will you quit worryin'?
There is no danger.

86
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,649
- But New York is...
- New York is like <i>Kansas</i> intensified.

87
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,774
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>What's that? Something the matter?</i>

88
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,322
No, Mom. That's just the TV.

89
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,776
- <i>It sounds so real.</i>
- <i>It's Miami Vice.</i>

90
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,073
<i>Can you turn the sound down?
It's too loud.</i>

91
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,281
Ma, it's broken.
The knob came off in my hand.

92
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:13,659
<i>Goodness. Well, what about
Uncle Howard? Did you call him?</i>

93
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,254
Uncle Howard!
Yeah, the phone number.

94
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,715
<i>Well, you still have
the number, don't you?</i>

95
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:22,052
Oh, yeah. I got it right here.

96
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,512
<i>Are you all right?
You seem distracted.</i>

97
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,589
They just totalled a Ferrari.

98
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,426
<i>But Uncle Howard...
did you call him?</i>

99
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,012
No, I haven't had a chance
to call Uncle Howard yet.

100
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,847
<i>Will you try to see him?</i>

101
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,810
I'll probably bump into him
at the country club.

102
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,356
<i>Get the TVfixed, dear.</i>

103
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,062
Yeah.

104
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,570
- Listen, I gotta go. Okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

105
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,406
- Give <i>Dad</i> my <i>love.</i>
- <i>I will, dear. Llove you, Brantley.</i>

106
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:50,330
- I love you <i>too,</i> Mom. Bye-bye.
- Bye!

107
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,536
Well, at least let me
buy you an airline ticket.

108
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,703
Dad, I'm gonna do this
on my own.

109
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,540
But you did make it
a round-trip ticket?

110
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,172
Yeah. I'm not gonna need it.

111
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,468
No, when I come back to Kansas,
I'm comin' back in my own jet.

112
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,611
Take this. It's Uncle Howard's
phone number in New York.

113
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,491
I got an uncle in New York?

114
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,456
My cousin Ellen married
his half sister's nephew...

115
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,376
before she got bit
by that dog and died.

116
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,829
But he's still kin,
and kin is kin.

117
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,186
Hi.

118
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,731
I'd like to see
Mr Prescott, please.

119
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,149
Do you have an appointment?

120
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,199
I tried to get one, but I couldn't,
so I just thought I'd surprise him.

121
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,656
Mr Prescott
doesn't like surprises.

122
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,909
- Everybody likes surprises.
- Not Mr Prescott.

123
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,913
- You can leave your name.
- Brantley Foster.

124
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,421
- Of?
- Of Kansas.

125
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,468
Of what company?

126
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,098
What do you wanna see
Mr Prescott about?

127
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,552
About being his nephew.

128
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,306
Well, why don't you
have a seat?

129
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,900
I'll see if I can work you
into Mr Prescott's schedule.

130
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,397
Thank you.

131
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,341
Give Uncle Howard my card.

132
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,264
Are you really
Mr Prescott's nephew?

133
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,226
In a roundabout sort of way.

134
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,734
You sons of bitches don't
have a half a brain between you!

135
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,067
I'm looking at
a $300 million deficit here...

136
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,619
because you idiots didn't anticipate
the needs of a changing market!

137
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,448
- <i>Uncle Howard?</i>
- <i>Now, get out, all of you!</i>

138
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,870
And bring me back some
new ideas that'll work!

139
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,461
Or I'll have your heads
mounted on my wall!

140
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,377
- Geez, he's gonna burst a blood vessel.
- Yeah, wishful thinking.

141
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,839
I'll see if I can
get you in now.

142
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,212
Thank you.

143
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,840
You know, it can't be good
for his heart to shout that way.

144
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,925
He doesn't have a heart.

145
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,264
- What, Maureen, what?
- Brantley Foster is here to see you.

146
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,394
I don't know any Brantley Foster.

147
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,225
- Your nephew from Kansas.
- Who?

148
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,856
- He says he's your nephew from Kansas.
- Kansas?

149
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,743
Mr Prescott will see you now.

150
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,917
Clever.

151
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,840
So you're one
of the Kansas Fosters, huh?

152
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,418
Shirttail relative,
to say the least.

153
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,382
Listen...

154
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,007
I know you probably told your secretary
to get me outta here in five minutes.

155
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,967
- Two.
- Right.

156
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:07,147
So I'll get right to the point.

157
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,435
- I need a job, Uncle Howard.
- Around here, I'm Mr Prescott.

158
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,149
Do you have any idea
what we do here?

159
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,650
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,109
Pemrose is a multinational conglomerate
with 27 different divisions.

161
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,237
Products ranging from dog food
to guided missile systems.

162
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,324
There are 30,000 people
working in this building alone.

163
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,376
Their accumulated salary is higher
than the gross national product...

164
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,250
of half the nations
in the Common Market.

165
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:36,210
Last year we borrowed more money
from banks than Mexico did.

166
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,460
It's a great company, Uncle...

167
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,715
Mr Prescott. That's why I'm here.

168
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,187
What can you do for us, Brantley?
What experience have you had?

169
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,107
Practically none.

170
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,611
But I believe in myself.

171
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,651
Doesn't that count? Deep inside, I know
I can do anything if I get a chance.

172
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,493
Think back to when
you were my ahe.

173
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,912
Remember how you felt when
you went after that first job.

174
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,910
Remember how
you wanted it so badly...

175
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,995
you couldn't sleep
the night before the interview.

176
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,252
Remember how crushed you were
when the guy said...

177
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,333
"What kind
of experience have you got?"

178
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,422
You wanted to shake
your fists and say...

179
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,054
"I can do anything
if I can just get a chance."

180
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,811
They're ready for you
in the boardroom, Mr Prescott.

181
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,606
Call Bates in Personnel.
Tell him I'm sending somebody up.

182
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,154
Well, you're
in the front <i>door,</i> kid.

183
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,858
What you do on this side of it
is up to you.

184
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,781
Congratulations. He really
must have taken a shine to you.

185
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,412
Thanks. He's a warm guy.

186
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,296
<i>May I'_›.</i>

187
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,575
You can't come in here, bozo.
Take your crap to the mail slot.

188
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,494
I work here. Just started.

189
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,417
What do you <i>want,</i> an engraved
invitation? Come on. Come on.

190
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,003
Brantley, eh?
Somebody gave you that name?

191
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,970
Jesus, a college puke!
This really makes my day.

192
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,343
- Well, you're welcome.
- Melrose, get over here!

193
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,807
Listen to what he says,
then do what he does.

194
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,652
Stay out of my way. Don't use
the stamp machine for personal letters.

195
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,071
Take off that stupid-looking tie.
<i>Looks</i> like you shot your couch.

196
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,524
- You got any questions?
- Yeah. What do I call you?

197
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,360
- Call me God.
- Got a problem, Boss? I'm your man.

198
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,237
Show the college puke the ropes
and keep him outta my face.

199
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,744
His name is Brantley.

200
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,201
All right, kid. Follow me.

201
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,581
<i>All right, you stick with me
and everything's gonna be copacetic.</i>

202
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,041
<i>Twice a day you deliver. Like a mailman,
you pick up whatever's goin'out.</i>

203
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,216
<i>I can do it in 30 minutes.
Rattigan thinks it takes me two hours.</i>

204
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,468
What's this department?
What do they do here?

205
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,552
Who knows? This place is a zoo.
Nobody knows what anybody else is doin'.

206
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,683
Can you get promoted
out of the mailroom?

207
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:01,938
You can't even get paroled
out of the mailroom. Excuse me, dear.

208
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,065
Good morning.

209
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,647
- Nix.
- What?

210
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,616
- Good morning.
- <i>Look,</i> not the suits.

211
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,160
- What do you mean?
- Excuse me, sir.

212
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,698
- Good morning.
- <i>Look,</i> not the suits, man.

213
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:19,166
You never consort with the suits,
unless they consort with you first.

214
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,254
That's ridiculous. He's a person.
I'm a person. I can't say hello?

215
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,081
He's not a person. He's a suit.

216
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,168
You're mailroom.
No consorting. Come on.

217
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,213
We're entering
a sensitive zone.

218
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,390
This guy in that office
just got canned.

219
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,059
Mailroom knew about it on Friday.
He just found out today.

220
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,229
No kidding.
Ls his job still open?

221
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,853
No, man, an economic cutback.
His job was dissolved.

222
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,481
About two dozen suits
got the ax.

223
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,361
Will you quit trying to consort?
Come on.

224
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,365
<i>All right,
the yellow ones go to purchasing.</i>

225
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,950
<i>All the white ones are a bunch
of suits talkin 'to themselves.</i>

226
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,427
You're supposed
to deliver 'em, not read 'em.

227
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,721
Some of this stuff
doesn't make any sense.

228
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,764
They send requisitions
through two departments...

229
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,513
to get procurements
for a third.

230
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,969
- What kind of thinking is that?
- That's suit thinking.

231
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,555
Something happens to a man
when he puts on a necktie.

232
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,515
Cuts off all the oxygen
to his brain.

233
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,773
You crazy? You're not supposed to
take the memos out of the mailroom.

234
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,779
I can't follow a chain of command
in this company.

235
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,203
They got the right title, but their job
assignments and objectives are screwed...

236
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,747
- Look at this. Jesus. Purchasing.
- What?

237
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,333
It's a joke. They've got two people
doin' basically the same job.

238
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,251
Neither one of them
is doin' it right.

239
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,328
I'll bring it up
at the next stockholders meeting.

240
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,632
- Would you put these things away?
- <i>Whoa,</i> Melrose.

241
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,636
How ya doin'? We've been gettin'
a lot of requests in the mailroom...

242
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,011
for stockholder information,
company assets, expenditures.

243
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,717
- Anything you can give us.
- You're kidding?

244
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,349
Any of this research you want,
you can have.

245
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,811
- Take it all.
- Thanks very much.

246
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,267
She's the most incredible-looking <i>woman</i>
I've ever seen in my life.

247
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,647
She's a Rolls-Royce,
but she's also a suit.

248
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,734
What's she like?
What do you know about her?

249
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,195
I know enough never
to consort with the suits, pal.

250
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:41,911
- Even when they do have legs like hers.
- Come on. You know more than that.

251
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,825
Her name is Christy Wills.

252
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,304
She's supposed to be some
sort of financial wizard, you know?

253
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,038
Harvard. All that crap.

254
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,251
And forget it.

255
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,517
No.
That's Transportation's problem.

256
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,899
No, we do not supply drivers
for executives' wives.

257
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,068
We are a messenger service.

258
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,117
I don't care
if the other drivers are all busy.

259
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,029
Yeah, <i>well,</i> the same
to you, sweetheart.

260
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,074
Hey, Dartmouth, get over here.

261
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,410
Executive's wife wants
a ride up to Litchfield.

262
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,792
- Check out a car and drive her.
- Where's Litchfield?

263
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,420
You'll find it.
Just follow the smell of money.

264
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,677
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm not quite sure which way...

265
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:52,061
Turn the key, start the car,
put it in drive and step on the gas.

266
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,892
Any idiot can do that,
even my husband.

267
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,448
Excuse me, ma'am.

268
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,151
- I know I'm not supposed to consort...
- Then don't.

269
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,873
You seem kind of upset. I was wonderin'
if there was anything I could do.

270
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,835
I don't know.
My cook quit this morning.

271
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,459
My analyst is away on vacation.
My Mercedes broke down.

272
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,300
I split my nail, and my husband
is screwing somebody at the office.

273
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,628
What did you have in mind?

274
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,593
Stick of gum?

275
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:32,222
This is the third weekend he's found
an excuse not to come to the country.

276
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:37,185
No, I don't know. But knowing him,
it's probably some teenage airhead...

277
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,936
from the steno pool.

278
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,323
The last one I caught him with
was so dumb...

279
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:46,410
she thought dictation
was some kind of S and M trip.

280
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,408
Do you know my husband?

281
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,536
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

282
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,492
Never mind.

283
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:57,500
- Didn't hear a thing.
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

284
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,918
I'm so mad, I could spit.

285
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,508
He <i>looks</i> twice as good today
<i>as</i> the day we were married.

286
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,631
I just look twice <i>as</i> old.

287
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,683
Are you kiddin'?

288
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,022
I hope that when I'm his age,
I can wake up every morning...

289
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,818
and find a woman as beautiful
as you are lying next to me.

290
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,646
Thank you.

291
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,621
Turn in here.

292
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,418
Please.

293
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:07,854
- Bring those inside. Charles.
- May I help you with those, sir?

294
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,813
What are you drinking?

295
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,612
I can't really.
I have to get back.

296
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,828
God, I hate the country.

297
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,624
<i>Yeah,</i> I can see
how you'd be real miserable here.

298
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,457
Who can live
with so many trees?

299
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,664
They suck up all the oxygen.

300
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,084
No, actually,
trees produce oxygen.

301
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,211
Who are you? Mr Wizard?

302
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,635
What did you say your name was?

303
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,892
- Brantley.
- No, I mean your first name.

304
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,597
That's it: Brantley.

305
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,229
Well, Brantley, I don't know what
you want out of Pemrose Corporation...

306
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,393
but I'll tell you
what you do not want.

307
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,814
You don't ever, ever
wanna become a corporate wife.

308
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,984
I'll watch my step.

309
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,957
Have another.

310
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,296
Thanks.

311
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,337
I've run 8,000 miles
on that tennis court...

312
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,262
chasing a fuzzy, little yellow ball
with an oversized racket.

313
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,180
Do my legs look heavy to you?

314
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,550
No.

315
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,013
I've swum laps from here
to the moon in that pool.

316
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,691
Do you see anything
in this body that isn't firm?

317
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,479
Tennis, swimming,
aerobics, jogging, massage...

318
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,484
Anything and everything
to stay in shape.

319
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,568
Not that he'd ever notice.

320
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,582
So, Brantley, do you know
why I stay in shape?

321
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,207
- How 'bout a dip in the pool?
- No, wait!

322
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,794
Are you serious? Listen...

323
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,972
I have to get back. This is a
tempting diversion, but I got a job.

324
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,722
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
- Transportation, please.

325
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,143
Yes. The young man from
the mailroom who drove me home?

326
00:30:06,144 --> 00:30:10,224
He's going to stay here
and do a little work in my garden.

327
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,445
See that he gets full credit
on his time card.

328
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,067
Thank you.

329
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,195
Help me out of this, will you, dear?

330
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,838
- That was great.
- Thanks. I swim five miles a day.

331
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,799
- Supposed to tone my ass.
- Yeah, it works.

332
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,933
Just when I thought it was safe
to go back in the water.

333
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,535
- You sure this is a good idea?
- It's okay. I know the owner.

334
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,371
<i>Last one out of</i> the...

335
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,788
- Sure your husband's not coming home?
- Who knows?

336
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,089
He could be home any minute...

337
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,880
or several hours from now.

338
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,799
Oh, my God.

339
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,362
I'm gonna see that
my husband gives you a leg up.

340
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,574
I think we've done pretty well
<i>so</i> far by ourselves.

341
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,404
I mean Pemrose.

342
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,368
No.

343
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,411
No, thanks.

344
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:56,165
No, I'm gonna make it
to the top by myself.

345
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,252
<i>God, you're adorable.</i>

346
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,768
I could spend a week
inside those sweet, unwrinkled eyes.

347
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:13,015
- Can I make a personal Observation?
- Anything but the thighs.

348
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,520
Somebody sold you a bill of goods and
convinced you you had to be 21 forever.

349
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,948
That's bullshit!
I think you're terrific.

350
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,651
The only thing wrong with you
is your husband is a jerk.

351
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,907
You're beautiful.
You're intelligent.

352
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,206
You're sensuous.

353
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,913
<i>Say that again!</i>

354
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,417
- Which part?
- All of it!

355
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,877
Oh, no!

356
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,218
- What? What is it?
- It's the jerk.

357
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,891
My husband.

358
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,939
- My uncle.
- Your what?

359
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,687
- Oh, God! That makes you...
- Auntie Vera?

360
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,162
What's my mother gonna say?

361
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,990
- I've disgraced my whole family.
- The hell you did!

362
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,745
Not funny! Okay?
This is not a funny moment in my life.

363
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,000
Relax. Who's gonna find out?

364
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,956
I'm home!

365
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,756
He's gonna find out.
That's Who's gonna find out.

366
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,883
Don't worry! He won't fire you.

367
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,636
There's no way I'm gonna
get a raise out of this.

368
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,685
<i>Vera, what's the company car
doing in the driveway?</i>

369
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,014
It broke down, darling. The driver
had to take the train back to town.

370
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,940
No, he didn't, darling. He's in here
having trouble with his fly.

371
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,314
- Get back! Do you ever stop?
- No!

372
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,563
How am I gonna get home?

373
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,445
Maybe we'll just have to keep you here
and adopt you.

374
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,818
<i>You're a riot, Vera.</i>

375
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,330
Please, Lord,
get me out of this.

376
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,633
I'll go all over the world telling
people not to screw the boss's wife.

377
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:08,009
- What are you doing in here?
- Feeling romantic.

378
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,591
What's for dinner?

379
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:15,020
<i>Oh, Howard! You really know how
to</i> sweep <i>a girl back onto her</i> feet.

380
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,945
Go back!

381
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,365
Sit! Sit down!

382
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,871
You look like death on a cracker, man.
What happened to you?

383
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,754
I was chased by a 200-pound dog
with a mouth as big <i>as</i> my head.

384
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,173
And that was the best thing
that happened last night.

385
00:34:47,174 --> 00:34:49,717
- What was the worst thing?
- I got laid.

386
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,177
I'm not sure you got
your priorities straight.

387
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,513
Hold the elevator.
Good morning.

388
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,940
Hi.

389
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,308
<i>We're entering a sensitive zone.</i>

390
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,602
<i>The guy in that office
just got canned.</i>

391
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,022
<i>The mailroom knew about it on Friday.
He just found out today.</i>

392
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,722
<i>I'm gonna see
that my husband gives you a leg up.</i>

393
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,899
No, thanks.

394
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,442
No.

395
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,280
No, I'm gonna make it
to the top on my own.

396
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,871
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Tucker, where the hell have you been?</i>

397
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,918
We got a problem
in Midwest Distribution.

398
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,543
What are you gonna do about it?

399
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,208
What's the problem?

400
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,841
Our stock is down
another quarter point this morning.

401
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,804
Whose fault is that, Thomas?

402
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,724
Nobody's fault, sir.
It's a momentary lapse in the market.

403
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,053
- Whose fault is it, Thomas?
- It's Davis's fault, sir.

404
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,351
His department hasn't been
pulling its weight.

405
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:48,520
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- I've been having troubles at home.

406
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,023
My wife ran over
the children's dog with her car...

407
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,104
then we had to buy a new dog.

408
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,408
Then the new dog chewed up this
entire report that I'd been working on.

409
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,362
Are you suggesting
that your dog ate your homework?

410
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,243
<i>In a way, yes, sir.</i>

411
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:06,122
This is not grade school, Davis!
Run at the back of the line.

412
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,203
- Consider yourself on warning.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,632
Everybody, check your pulse. Make sure
you're exercising at the optimum level.

414
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,345
I'm a bit above my level.
I better stop running now, maybe.

415
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,095
- I'm <i>above</i> too.
- I really don't care. Everybody, run!

416
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:25,600
<i>I can't get anybody's approval
for the extra two trucks!</i>

417
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,931
<i>Tucker, what're you
gonna do about it?</i>

418
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:32,607
All right, look.
What does a boxcar cost?

419
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,071
The transfer sheet
shows that somebody...

420
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,615
is accumulating
an enormous block of our stock.

421
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,111
- What do you think about that, Thomas?
- I think it's very encouraging.

422
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,403
- You do, do you?
- Yes, sir.

423
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,782
When a stock takes a dive
and somebody buys a ton of it...

424
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,209
it means that stock is
on its way to a quick rebound.

425
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,582
It means that the company
is ripe for a hostile takeover!

426
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,628
- That's what I meant!
- A hostile takeover, sir?

427
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,506
Yes. I'm afraid that's
what we're looking at.

428
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,553
I want each of you
to examine your department...

429
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,472
and see where you can cut costs.

430
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,557
Cut! Cut them to the core!

431
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,557
We need to raise capital quickly
<i>so</i> we can boost stock support.

432
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:10,436
Boost it! Boost it to the moon!

433
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,517
You gonna put that in writin'?

434
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,443
Yeah.

435
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,401
You tell the trucking company
that we have to service our customers.

436
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,987
If they're not gonna help us,
we're gonna find somebody who will.

437
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,868
Well, all right!

438
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:29,539
That's what we need, some gutsy
decisions! I'll get back to you.

439
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,790
Okay. Bye.

440
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,456
Yes!

441
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,261
I have got to get that report
by the end of the day, Art...

442
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:30,933
or you're in the doghouse!

443
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,852
I don't know. Mr Prescott?

444
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,821
I'm sorry this came in <i>so</i> late,
but it just arrived.

445
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,315
It's about time!

446
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,614
- This isn't the men's room.
- No.

447
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,576
They took the urinals out last week.
I didn't like them.

448
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,037
How about a paper cup?

449
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,120
What?

450
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,673
Sorry. I'm just about the only
woman executive at Pemrose.

451
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,877
Some days, I have a chip
about the men's room.

452
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,212
Sorry.

453
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,302
Hey, nice office.

454
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,555
Nice furniture.
It goes with your hair.

455
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,267
Thank you. I like your suit.
It goes nicely with your nose.

456
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,392
Well.

457
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,405
This conversation
isn't going very well.

458
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:27,486
Thank you. There's enough talk
in the world already. Good morning.

459
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,745
That meant "good-bye."

460
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,004
I have work.

461
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,215
Sorry.
I have a lot of work myself.

462
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,684
Good morning.

463
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,359
I really swept her
off her feet.

464
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,132
All right, Foster. Let's do it!

465
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,429
Hello. This is
Carlton Whitfield, 4319.

466
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,345
That's right. I'm still waiting for
that secretary I requested last week.

467
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,020
I realize you're
busy down there...

468
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,568
but I'm typing my own letters
and answering my own calls...

469
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,645
and it's getting to be a pain.

470
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,989
Empty?

471
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,490
Well, I've been here a week,
got my name on the door...

472
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,330
got a desk full of supplies and
a geranium on my window ledge.

473
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,749
What I don't have
is a secretary.

474
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,252
Okay, I'll tell you what.

475
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,798
I'll have Personnel send a boy up from
the mailroom with the requisitions.

476
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,795
Just send me my secretary, okay?
Thank you very much.

477
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,818
Got a memo here. Big cheese in 4319
wants his new secretary pronto.

478
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,899
I got a memo here that's
burning up my fingers.

479
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:34,533
New suit in 4319 wants his personalized
memos and stationery immediately.

480
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:36,452
- This guy is hot.
- Who?

481
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,495
I don't know.
Name's on the memo.

482
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:42,124
He wants nameplates for his <i>door,</i>
and he wants it by noon. Okay?

483
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,625
Smile.

484
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:51,012
- You're late.
- I already done my rounds.

485
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,760
You didn't punch in.

486
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,719
Well, I couldn't wait to get to it.
Boy, I love my work.

487
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,643
Punch in, then run this up to Personnel
and wait for an answer.

488
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,268
Right.

489
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,788
I'm Jean, your secretary.

490
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,795
I'm not wearing anything.

491
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,343
I see that.

492
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,753
It was warm.

493
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,675
Seems cooler now.
I'll get dressed.

494
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:41,270
Yes, sir.
I'll move my stuff in.

495
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,807
<i>Great, Jean. Good idea.</i>

496
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,580
Jean? I have some notes here.

497
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,579
I also have some charts,
some graphs, some tapes.

498
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,161
They're all sorted by department.
Can you read my handwriting?

499
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,996
- Sort of.
- Do your best.

500
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,874
I need some poster boards,
coloured pencils, coloured push pins...

501
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:14,554
T square, drawing table, lots of
pencils, and my lunch. Chinese?

502
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,305
- Hey, 4319?
- Yeah.

503
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,144
Great.

504
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,648
- Morning.
- Morning.

505
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,868
- Morning.
- Hi.

506
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,405
Hello again. Small world.

507
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,412
Hello.

508
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,498
Are you standing still
for some purpose?

509
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,960
Hey, I'm just soaking up
the atmosphere.

510
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,468
Executive lounge, huh?

511
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,763
- Care to do a little lounging?
- No, I'm busy.

512
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:27,979
Ron, did you get those figures
on transfer costs and insurance?

513
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:31,024
Not yet. Big delay in Chicago.

514
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,227
- Damn! I really need them!
- Blame Chicago.

515
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,312
- Maybe I can help.
- I'm sorry?

516
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,193
Transfer costs
and insurance for what?

517
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,991
By the time I explained,
I could find out myself.

518
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,486
Ron. Big weenie.

519
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,368
Hey, listen. Why don't you
explain it to me over lunch?

520
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,826
- I'll have the answer by dessert.
- I don't eat lunch.

521
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,667
Why don't we start this again?
Carlton Whitfield. And you're?

522
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,790
Annoyed. Shit.

523
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,460
You know, I'm just
trying to be friendly.

524
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,806
You picked a bad time. I was counting
on those figures from Ron.

525
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,971
- Christy Wills. How do you do?
- Good.

526
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:09,433
Terrible news. Just awful!

527
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,223
Conference room, everybody.
Come on. On the double.

528
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,063
- You don't eat lunch. Do you eat dinner?
- Occasionally.

529
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,772
- Tonight?
- Booked.

530
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,233
- Tomorrow night?
- Booked.

531
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,195
All right, but don't beg, okay?
It's embarrassing.

532
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,293
Who are you?

533
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,373
Carlton Whitfield.
New employee.

534
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,887
I didn't get a memo on that.

535
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,596
You will.

536
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:48,222
All right.
As long <i>as</i> I get the memo.

537
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,560
The absolute worst has happened.
We are the target of a corporate raid.

538
00:48:56,642 --> 00:49:00,647
Donald Davenport has filed a 13-D.

539
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,697
A 13-D?

540
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,775
He's acquired five percent
of the stock...

541
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:09,660
and this is definitely the beginning of
a hostile takeover of our corporation.

542
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,867
I think we all know what happened the
last time Davenport took over a company.

543
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,543
Everyone was canned!

544
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,877
Mr Prescott has sent down word
of what he <i>wants</i> us to do.

545
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,586
We are to recommend cuts
in every department.

546
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:27,762
Our job is to slash the red ink
in every nook and cranny...

547
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,765
because our company needs
the cash for its defence.

548
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,019
Anybody wanna fire
the first shot?

549
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,060
Kill Toledo.

550
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,194
If we close down
our distribution centres...

551
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,071
in Toledo, Joplin, Jacksonville...

552
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,570
we'll slash the red ink
completely off the books.

553
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,037
Whitfield, you don't have
to raise your hand. Just speak.

554
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,834
Thank you.

555
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,412
Well, I know I'm new here
and everything.

556
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,586
On the surface, these cuts
seem like a good idea...

557
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,338
"Seem like a good idea"?

558
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,928
But closing down those distribution
centres would be a big mistake.

559
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,507
It <i>so</i> happens that those closings
are exactly what Mr Prescott wants.

560
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,927
Well, then Mr Prescott hasn't
thought things through very well.

561
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,597
I'm going to tell him you said that.

562
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,270
Good. Closing down
those centres...

563
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,648
will put a strain on
this company's cash position.

564
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,901
In the long run, those cuts are going
to hurt this company's innate value.

565
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:28,322
Innate value?
What is he talking about?

566
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,199
Davidson here will back me up
on this. Davidson?

567
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,871
I'm Proctor. He's Davidson.

568
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,990
Well, damn it,
Davidson, tell him!

569
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,793
You wrote a memo to Mr Thomas
explaining what I'm talking about.

570
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,246
Well, how did you know
I wrote that memo?

571
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,003
How did I know
you wrote that memo?

572
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,560
Who else could write
that memo, Davidson?

573
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,980
That memo was famous.

574
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,057
That memo was a masterpiece.

575
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,020
Clear, concise, to the point.
That was the best damn memo I ever read!

576
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,857
In fact, that memo wasn't even a memo.
That memo was literature.

577
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:09,654
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

578
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,237
If you have finished your book report,
could you explain what your point is?

579
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:16,832
- The point is, we gotta be bold.
- That's my point.

580
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,831
We gotta build. We gotta expand.

581
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,709
Expanding is the only way
to help the situation.

582
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,798
We gotta make
this company so damn strong...

583
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,218
Davenport won't be able to find anyone
willing to give up Pemrose stock.

584
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,468
It'll be too damn valuable.
Then we'll buy his ass out!

585
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,806
- How old are you, Mister...
- Whitfield.

586
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,974
- Yes.
- Twenty-four.

587
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,606
I think you should keep quiet
until you're at least 25.

588
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:49,191
If I may, I don't think Whitfield's age
should be an issue here.

589
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:52,319
No one is interested
in your opinion, Davis.

590
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,779
We gotta block that takeover.

591
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,864
I'm too old to look
for another job.

592
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,075
Nobody in their right mind
would hire me.

593
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:06,591
This meeting is going nowhere!

594
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,256
Mr Prescott's command stands!

595
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,555
We are to find those cuts!

596
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,473
Meeting adjourned.

597
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,477
You'll pick up the coats.
That looks like one only a lot smaller.

598
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,150
Hey! Harvard!
Where the hell've you been?

599
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:29,526
Personnel. You said to wait for
an answer. They are real slow up there.

600
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,280
There's something going on
around here, Foster.

601
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,784
I'm gonna be on you like a rash.
You got that? Like a rash.

602
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,124
Won't the other guys get jealous?
Heads!

603
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,915
You guys were good tonight.

604
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,185
Oh, God.
What are you doin' here?

605
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,564
Brantley, darling, I heard you calling
me telepathically... I'm very psychic...

606
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,736
<i>so</i> of course
I rushed right over.

607
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:38,534
- I would've used the phone.
- Mental telepathy's much more reliable.

608
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,242
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

609
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,501
Yeah. Sorry.

610
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,328
Just a minute.

611
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,425
Father used to live like this
before he founded Pemrose.

612
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,343
Aunt Vera...

613
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,726
I had a hell of a day,
and I really have to get some sleep.

614
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,480
Brantley, you're a young man.

615
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:15,112
Young men have lots of energy.

616
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,404
<i>Look.</i>

617
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,034
- We have a problem.
- What?

618
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,368
Your husband is my boss.

619
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,624
Oh, him. We won't tell him.

620
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,337
Besides,
Howard's working late tonight.

621
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,131
On <i>whom,</i> I have no idea.

622
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,760
You look very beautiful
tonight, Christy.

623
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,515
Thank you. <i>Now,</i> there are some
business things we should discuss.

624
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:50,139
Do you think that this restaurant
has an upstairs with beds in it?

625
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,645
Howard, please!

626
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:56,194
I don't feel altogether good
about what's happened between us.

627
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,193
You are married.

628
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,992
- I'm not married.
- You are married!

629
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:06,117
Well, yeah, I am married,
but she and I have an understanding.

630
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,011
- I love you.
- I don't really think so.

631
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:32,522
Well, then I lust after you.
That oughta be worth something.

632
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:34,976
To you, perhaps.
Now, let's talk business.

633
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,481
I pitched the need for cutbacks
at the meeting today...

634
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,777
but a dissenting opinion <i>was</i> offered
by Carlton Whitfield.

635
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:43,571
Who's Carlton Whitfield?
I didn't hire any Carlton Whitfield.

636
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,239
Somebody did.

637
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,493
- Oh, my God. Donald Davenport.
- What?

638
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,701
He may be a plant for Davenport,
gathering information on the takeover.

639
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,583
It's just like him. I want you
to get close to this guy Whitfield.

640
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,380
Find out what he's up to.

641
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,630
- You want me to spy on him?
- No, I don't want you to spy on him.

642
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,677
I want you to get
to be friends with him...

643
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,755
then rifle through his papers
and tell me what you find.

644
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,715
That's spying, Howard.

645
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,847
<i>Look,</i> you have got to drop
this incessant innocence.

646
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,898
Life is harsh and ugly,
and only the strong survive.

647
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,066
Or didn't they teach you that
at Harvard?

648
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,652
- What you got in there?
- My lunch.

649
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,825
Your lunch? In a briefcase?

650
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,653
Yeah. Ran out of brown bags.

651
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,282
One of you guys got
a spare pair of laces?

652
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,788
Hey, man, I had a babe last night
you wouldn't believe.

653
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:38,418
"Ta-Na's" out to here, man.
She was fine. Where'd he go?

654
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,730
- Coming through. Excuse me.
- Take it easy. Come on.

655
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,982
Sorry.

656
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,219
- What a nightmare.
- Stuck again?

657
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,430
- I'm all right, though. I'm fine.
- You okay?

658
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:40,563
- You all right?
- Don't worry about me. Thanks.

659
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:44,943
<i>Jean,</i> transcribe these notes. There's
some things on there I need right away.

660
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,568
Make copies of this,
copies of this.

661
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,028
- Did you get those supplies I needed?
- Yes, sir.

662
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:54,206
Good. I'll be back later.

663
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,872
- Gentlemen.
- Good morning.

664
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,308
- Goddam that thing!
- This thing stuck again?

665
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,513
These elevators are stuck again?

666
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:24,358
I'm sick and tired of these
elevators always gettin' stuck.

667
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,414
Hi, Jean. Will you take
those to the cleaners?

668
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,269
These are <i>some</i> of the notes
I found in Whitfield's office.

669
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:04,397
If you want anything more,
you can go after it yourself.

670
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:06,771
Do you think he's working
for Davenport?

671
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:11,029
I have no idea.
I'm out of the spy business.

672
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,866
We can't wait for Whitfield
any longer. Let's get started.

673
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:23,246
Davis here has prepared what I'm sure
is a thoroughly incompetent analysis...

674
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:25,748
but let's listen to him read it
before we start criticizing.

675
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,799
Fine. I won't read it at all.
Is that all right?

676
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,923
You have a bad attitude, and I am
gonna tell Mr Prescott about it.

677
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,551
Does anybody else
have anything to say?

678
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,510
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

679
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,766
Sorry. Hi, everybody.

680
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,769
Casual attire today, Whitfield?

681
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:47,853
Yeah, trousers, yeah.

682
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,982
New product line.
Testing 'em out. Pretty good.

683
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,567
- Good fabric.
- Good idea.

684
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,783
- Christy, you have something to say.
- Yes.

685
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,832
I came up with some more cuts
in the Middle States area.

686
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,749
Let me pass these out.

687
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:05,204
Why can't you be
more like her, Davis?

688
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,250
Mr Prescott!
Well, what a surprise!

689
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,758
Art, I haven't received
the full report on the cutbacks yet...

690
01:01:13,759 --> 01:01:16,347
<i>so</i> I thought I'd drop in
and see what the problem is.

691
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,388
No problem.
No, sir. Everything is tip-top.

692
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,765
Whitfield has pointed out
a few wrinkles...

693
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,769
and we are going
to iron those wrinkles out.

694
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,901
You don't mind
if I stay for a few minutes, do you?

695
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,728
Yes, sir.

696
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,365
- Which one of you is Whitfield?
- Oh, my God!

697
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,364
Nosebleed! Dry heat!
Get 'em all the time!

698
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,242
Oh, God!
No sight for the squeamish.

699
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:42,281
<i>Who was that?</i>

700
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,580
Well, that's the new boy, Whitfield.

701
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:54,837
Sorry.

702
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,343
Needed some supplies.

703
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,720
Well, back to business.

704
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,428
A few of these, and...

705
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,184
Oh, God!

706
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,605
You're from Receiving,
aren't you?

707
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,645
<i>Isee you're a workaholic.</i>

708
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,158
Yeah, well...

709
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,946
I got a lot of work to do.

710
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:26,994
- What are you doing here so late?
- I'm a workaholic too.

711
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,997
Wow. You mean we have
something in common?

712
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:36,883
So, what's all this supposed to be?

713
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:41,386
It's the heart and soul of an idea
you hated: Expansion in the Midwest.

714
01:02:41,387 --> 01:02:43,681
I don't hate it.
I just think it's risky.

715
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,811
Furthermore,
Mr Prescott doesn't want it.

716
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,265
It's a waste of time to pursue it.

717
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:51,943
But if something's right,
how can it be a waste of time?

718
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:55,272
There is no right or wrong.
There is only opinion.

719
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:01,866
You know, in <i>some</i> states,
you can get arrested for saying that.

720
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,120
All right. Convince me.

721
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,745
Convince me then that
your opinion is the right one.

722
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,539
All right.

723
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:16,210
Take a look at this. And this.

724
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,504
<i>And, yeah.</i>

725
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,927
<i>Peruse that.</i>

726
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:25,261
Why do you keep saying
the exact opposite of what I say?

727
01:03:25,262 --> 01:03:29,106
- 'Cause you keep saying stupid things.
- Will you look at these figures?

728
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,353
They prove that
the elimination of salaries...

729
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,114
would create a war chest for
the defence of the Pemrose Corporation.

730
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,346
- Can't you see that?
- No, I can't. I'll tell you why.

731
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,483
Closing those factories is just gonna
send a panic through the market.

732
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:43,070
- That might happen or that might not.
- No, it will happen.

733
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:46,915
All right, close the centres,
put thousands of people out of work.

734
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,834
You're gonna <i>waste</i> all your profits
on unemployment contributions...

735
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,537
severance pay, union lawsuits.

736
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,044
Are you all right?

737
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,922
- My blood sugar's dropping.
- What?

738
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,424
It's just my mind wandered in
the middle of what you were saying.

739
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:04,224
It means I need food.
Do you <i>wanna</i> get a bite?

740
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,270
- Yeah, come on. I'll buy you dinner.
- No, no, no. Dutch.

741
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:14,067
Just tell me one more time
what your solution is to this crisis.

742
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:18,022
- We don't cut. We expand.
- I agree.

743
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,449
Expansion is a positive reaction
to the universe.

744
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,198
While retraction
or cutting back or pulling off...

745
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,951
Those are all negative forces.

746
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:31,126
I used to be very negative, and
then I took this personality workshop.

747
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,502
My whole life turned around.

748
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,460
Hiya. My name's Sheila.

749
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,544
You make a good-lookin' couple.
How long you been goin' together?

750
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:44,302
- About 20 minutes.
- First <i>date,</i> huh? Good luck.

751
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,383
No, we're business colleagues.

752
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,764
Colleagues! Who needs that?

753
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,062
You should go together.
You look good together.

754
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,318
Did you wanna order?

755
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:02,069
- Yeah, we need to see some menus.
- Menus! I'm sorry.

756
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,653
I'm studying to be an actress. I'm
a better actress than I am a waitress.

757
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,660
Concentration, that's my big problem.
I'll be right back.

758
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,204
Well, Sheila's in favour
of expansion.

759
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:18,503
We should bring her to our next meeting.
Art Thomas would like her a lot.

760
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,501
Sheila is also in favour of us
seeing each other.

761
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,963
- Yes, well, Sheila is clearly a nut.
- I heard that.

762
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,344
You should try to be
more positive with your life...

763
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,809
or you're gonna wind up miserable.

764
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,386
She heard me.

765
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,517
I'm having a nice time.
How 'bout you?

766
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,612
Yes, very nice.

767
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,610
Well, it's pleasant walking.

768
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,283
I <i>mean,</i>
I don't want to imply anything.

769
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:51,032
About your expansion plan,
I did some checking...

770
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:55,961
and we can get some tax breaks if we
put up a facility in the Midwest region.

771
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:59,172
You checked? Earlier today?

772
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,874
That's great.

773
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,631
The powers that be seem
to want the cutting, but I...

774
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:08,261
I've been trying to stay open
to your ideas... your business ideas.

775
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,054
That's great.

776
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,066
Okay, so you're
open to my business ideas.

777
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,227
Now, how about
my after-work ideas?

778
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,983
Don't push. Yesterday,
I thought you were obnoxious.

779
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,743
You know, a lot of people
start out that way.

780
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,334
- They usually end up gettin' married.
- Don't hold your breath.

781
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,127
Come on.

782
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,125
<i>Look,</i> I think
you're secretly crazy about me.

783
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:46,508
And I think you'd feel a lot better
if you'd just admit it.

784
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,300
Come on. You'll like me.
I'm an acquired taste.

785
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:11,286
My dad insisted
on buying me this.

786
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,244
A round-trip ticket
back to Kansas.

787
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,118
I almost traded it in
a couple of times.

788
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,001
But now, it's kind of a symbol.

789
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,340
The day I use this ticket...

790
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,043
is the day New York
has beaten me.

791
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,089
You know,
I just noticed something.

792
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:35,511
- You're kind of a mess.
- Thank you.

793
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,767
- Did anybody ever tell you that?
- You're the first.

794
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,190
So what I was wonderin' was...

795
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:46,562
how you can be
<i>so</i> incredibly beautiful...

796
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,691
and be such a mess?

797
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,945
When two people get involved
on a project together...

798
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,373
there's a danger
of getting emotionally involved.

799
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,626
That would be bad.

800
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:04,047
They confuse the intensity
of their involvement on the project...

801
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,375
and mistake it
<i>as a</i> relationship.

802
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:13,130
- What are you, a shrink?
- It's happened to me.

803
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:15,429
It's actually still happening
to me, I guess.

804
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,806
And then...

805
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:21,355
the project ends and they find
they don't have anything to talk about.

806
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,523
Okay, it's settled then.

807
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,945
We won't get involved
while we're working on this project.

808
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,573
Right.

809
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,504
<i>So who is he?</i>

810
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:45,956
Who?

811
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,963
Who? My competition.

812
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,715
Just a guy.

813
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:54,055
All right,
<i>so</i> why don't we call this guy?

814
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,132
Tell him you met a new guy.
The whole thing is off.

815
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,970
- I can't call him.
- Why not?

816
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,431
His wife might answer
the phone.

817
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,560
- Big mistake.
- Yeah, well, let's not talk about it.

818
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:10,614
- I've done a lot of stupid things...
- I bet you have.

819
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,440
- But I have never...
- Ever?

820
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,612
Been involved with a married man.

821
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,745
Well, he was sort of separated
when we started.

822
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,291
Yeah, <i>well,</i>
it turned out to be a lie.

823
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:28,965
The whole thing was a mistake.

824
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,927
But we live and we learn
and we move on...

825
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,144
That wasn't bad.

826
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,733
Thank you.

827
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,488
Can you do it again
just as good?

828
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,246
I could try.

829
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,361
- Where were you all weekend?
- At least begin with "good morning."

830
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,940
I'm madder than hell!

831
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,576
I want to know why
you weren't answering your phone.

832
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,619
I owe a lot to you, Howard.

833
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:25,073
I'll always be grateful for the chance
you gave me in this company...

834
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,991
and the things I've learned.

835
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,787
What is this?
What are you leading up to?

836
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,668
<i>I wanna work with you.</i>

837
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:35,546
<i>Irespect you
more than you know, but...</i>

838
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:40,180
I can't be involved with you
outside the office any more.

839
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,175
Hello?

840
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:55,229
Yes, I'm looking for the transportation
<i>costs</i> from Toledo dating September...

841
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,109
I'll call you back.

842
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,453
<i>Look,</i> I'm not
gonna pressure you on this.

843
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,405
I want you to take your own time...

844
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,617
and decide what's best for you.

845
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,459
Thank you.

846
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,707
I do think the timing's
a little ironic, though.

847
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,714
I was gonna tell you
last night...

848
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,930
that Vera and I have agreed
on terms for a divorce.

849
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:28,436
I only wish that Vera and I
could have worked things out sooner.

850
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:32,065
That way, you and I
might have had a chance.

851
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:37,278
This arrived this morning
by messenger.

852
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,940
Davenport has called
an emergency meeting...

853
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,698
of the board of directors
for Monday morning...

854
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:47,242
and he's offering
to take over the company.

855
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,998
I'm inviting all key personnel to spend
the weekend at my house in Litchfield.

856
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,671
I'd like you to be there too.

857
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,958
Of course I'll be there.

858
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:04,677
One more question... personal.

859
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:09,018
Just out of curiosity,
who were you with last night?

860
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,644
Whitfield. Carlton Whitfield.

861
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:18,444
It was all business.
Some of his ideas are brilliant.

862
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,944
I'm looking forward to hearing 'em.
I have to talk to him today.

863
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:28,034
Those notes that I took from Whitfield's
office... I'd like them back, please.

864
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,956
Of course.
I'll get them to you.

865
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,205
Heads up. Thanks.

866
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:39,039
What's your hurry?
What's goin' on?

867
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,418
I got a special delivery
here marked "urgent."

868
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,260
I'm watching you, Foster.

869
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,134
Just remember, every minute...

870
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,180
God is watching you.

871
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:52,429
Excuse me, Miss, I'm a reporter for the
Times, and I couldn't help noticing...

872
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,672
you look like <i>a woman</i>
Who's recently been made love to.

873
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,978
- Not here.
- You weren't made love to here.

874
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:59,607
Was it anywhere within the New York
State lines, because we usually let...

875
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,609
<i>the philadelphia Gazette
handle Pennsylvania.</i>

876
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,909
What's up?
You seem kind of upset.

877
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,078
I hate men.

878
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,406
Well, I'm glad
I'm not one of'em.

879
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,376
Listen, there's something
I gotta explain to you.

880
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:19,206
I have something to tell you too.
I did something I wish I hadn't, and...

881
01:14:19,207 --> 01:14:20,707
All right, look.

882
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,677
- This weekend?
- Can't.

883
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:29,053
- I <i>have some loose ends to tie up.</i>
- Good!

884
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:32,385
- I'll take care of it.
- Have a nice weekend. See you Monday.

885
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:39,813
Excuse me, Miss.
I'm sorry. Excuse me!

886
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,479
You didn't see me.
I wasn't here.

887
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,240
- Where is he? Where'd he go?
- I didn't see him. He wasn't here.

888
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,919
You still here?

889
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,588
You look great.

890
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:10,757
The end of the second lap,
you still got a comfortable lead.

891
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,847
Excuse me again.

892
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,310
- Hi, boss.
- Shit!

893
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:26,943
Bye, boss.

894
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:32,028
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

895
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,079
Looking for Whitfield.
Got a delivery for him.

896
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:35,782
Why are you wearing a suit?

897
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:40,586
- Because of the funeral.
- Whose funeral?

898
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:44,131
A friend. He died.
We buried him.

899
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,009
What is all this stuff?

900
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,056
Production performance charts
for the Midwest region, I guess.

901
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:56,644
Where is Whitfield?

902
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,472
He's not here?

903
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:03,516
- Have you ever seen Whitfield?
- Yes, sir.

904
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,144
Well, lots of times.

905
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,860
I deliver here every day.
Great guy.

906
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,862
How does he get
all this information?

907
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:14,286
Well, it's available in most
quarterly stock reports...

908
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,202
probably.

909
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,836
- Take this up to my office.
- Yes, sir.

910
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:31,095
- You're not comin'?
- L'II be there in a minute.

911
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:44,854
One question:
What the hell are you doin'?

912
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,437
- Having a nervous breakdown.
- No wonder.

913
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,400
<i>Look,</i> nothin' good can come from this.
If you get caught, you get canned.

914
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,720
If you don't get caught, you become
one of them... a suit.

915
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:57,159
- It's a no-win situation.
- I'm still a half a step ahead of them.

916
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:12,710
<i>I hear music when I look at you.</i>

917
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:15,931
Aunt Vera, hi. How are you?

918
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:21,057
<i>I'm in the mood for love.</i>

919
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,983
<i>Simply because you're near me.</i>

920
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,981
A medley. Gee, that's nice.

921
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,108
Why are you singing a medley?

922
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:34,112
<i>I get no kick from champagne.</i>

923
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:40,039
- <i>Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all</i>
- <i>Please, don't sing any more.</i>

924
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,659
Oh, God!

925
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,536
I haven't sung in years.
You see what you do to me?

926
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,292
He's on his way up.

927
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:50,966
He's gonna be here any minute.
Why are you doing this?

928
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,799
- I'm going to have you for lunch.
- Can't I get you a ham and cheese?

929
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:55,880
Look at that
cute little Adam's apple.

930
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:59,801
Listen. Oh, shit. Since the last time
we met, there's been a change.

931
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:02,012
Yes, nice suit, Brantley.

932
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:06,523
<i>Look,</i> what I mean to say is...
Oh, Christ!

933
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,268
- I'm not free any more.
- You're gonna charge me?

934
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,911
You're getting awfully cynical.
Does your mother know about this?

935
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:16,317
- No, I mean I'm not available!
- Good, you're not gonna charge me.

936
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:19,654
Don't worry, Brantley. I don't <i>wanna</i>
marry you. I'm already married.

937
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,281
- I just <i>wanna</i> love you.
- Love.

938
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,743
I don't mean love as in two star-crossed
virginettes running through the clover.

939
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:29,334
Nothing icky like that. I'm a practical
woman. You should be a practical man.

940
01:18:29,335 --> 01:18:33,051
If you just let me, I could steer you
through these shark-infested waters...

941
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,590
of this stupid company
just like I steered Howard.

942
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:38,798
<i>Look,</i> I like you. I really like you.
But I gotta tell you.

943
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,636
I've become seriously and emotionally
involved with someone who isn't my aunt.

944
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,314
- I forgive you, Brantley.
- Listen!

945
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,396
- There is someone else in my life!
- I got it. I don't care.

946
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,443
There's someone else
in my life too.

947
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:54,567
Maybe we should introduce
your girlfriend and my husband.

948
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:58,368
<i>Look,</i> I don't wanna get rough with you,
but I'll belt you around if I have to.

949
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:02,239
Jesus Christ, Vera!
I'm gonna get fired. Gimme a break.

950
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,494
Don't whine, Brantley.
Life is too short.

951
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,998
Before you know it, you'll be 25,
wondering where it all went.

952
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:14,167
- What the hell is this?
- He fainted.

953
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,502
Fainted?

954
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:20,340
- Dead away.
- Actually, he hit his head.

955
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,551
- It was like fainting. Knocked out.
- Hit his head on what?

956
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,102
- The floor.
- The ceiling.

957
01:19:25,103 --> 01:19:26,562
- Which one?
- Both.

958
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,890
- Neither.
- What the hell happened?

959
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:31,692
Uncle Howard, it was like this.

960
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,236
I walked into your office...

961
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:37,230
and I saw this beautiful woman...

962
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:39,484
who I had never seen before
in my life.

963
01:19:39,485 --> 01:19:43,408
And imagine my surprise
when I found out it was my Aunt Vera.

964
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:47,492
Well, he was so excited,
his blood pressure shot up...

965
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,622
and then he fell and
hit his head on the floor.

966
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:54,583
Out like a light.
So I crawled deliriously to the sofa.

967
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:57,259
- And I rushed to his aid.
- And you walked in.

968
01:19:57,418 --> 01:20:01,639
And shame on you for not telling me
our nephew's working for the company.

969
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,512
Our nephew works
for the company.

970
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,470
I've got a million things
to take care of today.

971
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,519
- Why are you here?
- Lunch.

972
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,689
- We were supposed to have lunch.
- I've had my lunch.

973
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:14,564
- You don't seem to realize...
- I do realize, Howard.

974
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:17,943
So, you won't mind if Brantley and I go
out to lunch to get better acquainted?

975
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:22,108
- Fine.
- I can't. I gotta go to a funeral.

976
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,328
You said you already went.

977
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,662
You <i>know,</i> in my grief, lforgot.

978
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:34,793
Why don't we bring Brantley out
to the house this weekend for the party?

979
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,715
I <i>mean,</i> he is family.

980
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:41,755
Yes, you <i>know,</i> that might be
a very good idea.

981
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,885
No, I don't think
I'd fit in, Aunt Vera.

982
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:46,683
But you do fit in, Brantley.

983
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,853
I'll make sure he has a wonderful time.

984
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:52,932
All right. It's settled.
Now, can I get back to work here?

985
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,773
It'll be nice to have
a playmate for the weekend.

986
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:10,370
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, <i>yeah,</i> Brantley.

987
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:13,999
I want you to know I've been
watching you very closely lately.

988
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:17,833
- You have?
- I know everything you've been up to.

989
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:21,135
- You do?
- Everything.

990
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:26,800
Sir, I can explain this.
See, I didn't know who that was...

991
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,681
I know, for example, that you've
been working hard in the mailroom.

992
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,888
You've kept your eyes open
and your nose clean.

993
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,847
You stayed out of trouble.

994
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,393
I'm gonna reward you for that
one of these days.

995
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:41,863
But first I'd like to ask
a favour of you.

996
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,067
You name it, sir.

997
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,494
We'll talk about it
while we work out.

998
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,661
You like to sweat,
don't you, Brantley?

999
01:21:57,287 --> 01:22:00,507
Your Aunt Vera seems to have
taken an instant liking to you.

1000
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:05,425
- I hadn't noticed.
- It's obvious.

1001
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:08,804
I think she'd like to get
to know you a lot better.

1002
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,680
I want to encourage that.

1003
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:14,100
I'd like you to spend
lots of time with Aunt Vera...

1004
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,227
at the party this weekend.

1005
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:22,563
Men like us can't be locked in
to one woman, Brantley.

1006
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:27,072
We need variety.
Keeps us young, energetic, competitive.

1007
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:31,571
You get my meaning? Of course you do.
We're men of the world, right?

1008
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:34,200
Now, a problem has developed.

1009
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:38,004
- I have a friend, a companion...
- A girl.

1010
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,503
She's been getting
a little antsy lately.

1011
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,380
Wants me to leave my wife.

1012
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:47,134
Well, I'm not about to leave my wife...
not for her, not for anyone.

1013
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:50,807
I just need a little time to get
the situation under control again.

1014
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,557
- Understand?
- Not altogether.

1015
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,055
Well, I'm inviting her out
to the party this weekend...

1016
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,641
and we're gonna spend
a little time together...

1017
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,234
which is why I need you
to keep your Aunt Vera...

1018
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,029
occupied as much as possible.

1019
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:06,482
- Get the picture?
- Yeah, wide-screen.

1020
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:10,238
- But I got some big plans this weekend.
- Fine. I won't forget this favour.

1021
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:13,205
- No, you don't understand. See...
- Great. It's all settled then.

1022
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:17,372
I've got my eye out for some rapid
advancement for you, Brantley.

1023
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:21,422
You seem to be a young man
with a lot on the ball. Keep it up.

1024
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,257
Schmuck.

1025
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,975
That's nice.

1026
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:38,355
Excuse me. Brantley, darling,
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

1027
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,612
I'm going to introduce you to the most
powerful money men in New York.

1028
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,564
If you can do to them
what you've done to me...

1029
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:50,652
- I can't do that.
- I mean bowl them over, darling.

1030
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:53,829
You're irresistible
when you turn on that boyish charm.

1031
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,453
- Hi, Whitfield.
- Whitfield?

1032
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,534
Yeah, it's my middle name.
Brantley Whitfield...

1033
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,585
- Hi, Carlton.
- Carlton Foster.

1034
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:03,790
- You go by all those names?
- Yeah, I got a lot of'em.

1035
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:07,718
My parents couldn't make up their mind.
My monogram looks like an eye chart.

1036
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:12,139
You're always surprising me, Brantley.
That's your most attractive quality.

1037
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,551
Promise me you'll never stop.

1038
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:20,097
- I promise.
- Good. Now.

1039
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,855
Roland Owens, First Federal.
Very rich. We start with him.

1040
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,687
He made his money
the really old-fashioned way.

1041
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,738
He inherited it.

1042
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:30,816
And see the man playing tennis
with the elbow brace...

1043
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,526
the knee strap and the glove?

1044
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:35,783
Vernon S. Fletcher,
Wall Street's iron man.

1045
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:39,787
If he likes you, you can write
your own ticket, and he'll like you.

1046
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:41,868
Who's the tall guy
with all the girls?

1047
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:45,707
Good eye, Brantley.
Harley McMasters, First Multinational.

1048
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:50,678
Recently divorced. They're all dying to
be the second Mrs First Multinational.

1049
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:55,640
Listen, you're not gonna tell anybody
I work in the mailroom, are ya?

1050
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,517
Trust me, Brantley.

1051
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,812
I got Howard his key
to the executive washroom.

1052
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:01,888
I can do the <i>same</i> thing for you.

1053
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,863
Here are Whitfield's notes.

1054
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,526
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

1055
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:19,828
This is supposed to be
a business trip, remember?

1056
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,876
Baby, how can I concentrate
on business?

1057
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:25,503
Howard, let me go!

1058
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,549
What are you doing here?

1059
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:41,060
Would Carlton Whitfield
miss a party?

1060
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:44,390
- I'm so glad you're here.
- So am I.

1061
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,060
Quick!

1062
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,612
Stop! Not here!

1063
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,326
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1064
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:59,325
Wait. I gotta tuck.
You go first. Go first.

1065
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,499
- How do I look?
- Come on. Come on.

1066
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:05,293
Well, I've had a look
at that preliminary report...

1067
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:08,873
and I'm satisfied that the proposed
cutbacks are our best line of defence.

1068
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:12,126
Thank you, sir. We have tried
to cut hard and to cut deep.

1069
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:16,589
- Yes. The job was adequately done.
- Thank you, sir.

1070
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,391
I think Whitfield is right,
and this report is wrong.

1071
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:07,332
- Have you seen Christy?
- No, I haven't, sir. Not for a while.

1072
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:13,331
- Have you seen Christy?
- Sorry. No, I haven't.

1073
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:18,172
- Jack.
- Yes, Howard.

1074
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,003
Have you seen Christy Wills?

1075
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:22,054
She's talking to Whitfield.

1076
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,646
No? Come on.
That's my best... trust me.

1077
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,564
It's my best one.

1078
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,018
Would you excuse us
for a minute, Christy?

1079
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:43,448
Brantley, did you know
that Whitfield is here?

1080
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,450
Yeah, I think he was
here earlier, but he left.

1081
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:49,625
No. Somebody saw him
a few minutes ago talking to Christy.

1082
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,411
<i>Now, I've got</i> my <i>reasons.</i>

1083
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,414
I want you to stay
close to Christy...

1084
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:58,671
and keep Whitfield
away from her.

1085
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,253
Can you do that for me?

1086
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,380
Hey, I'm your man.

1087
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:06,808
Good. I knew
I could count on you.

1088
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,565
What was that all about?

1089
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:19,021
Well, he wants me to stay
<i>as close</i> to you <i>as</i> possible.

1090
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,986
- He told you that?
- Yeah.

1091
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:26,028
I don't know. I guess he thinks
we make a good couple.

1092
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,161
Are you awake?

1093
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:06,331
Darling?

1094
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,634
Sweetheart, it's Howard.

1095
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:55,259
- Go away!
- Let's make this a night to remember.

1096
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:58,516
Darling, I know
you're angry with me...

1097
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:02,437
but think of all the things
that we've meant to each other.

1098
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:06,225
I want to marry you, Christy.

1099
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,075
Don't be that way, baby.

1100
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:26,290
What do you say?
Will you marry me?

1101
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:28,872
No, but I'd like
to beat the shit outta you!

1102
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:37,259
Wait till I get my..

1103
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,977
Who is that?

1104
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:46,097
Oh, my God!

1105
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,392
Oh, my God!

1106
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:51,978
The sexual revolution is over.
Everybody, out of bed.

1107
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:56,028
What are you doing
in Christy's bed, Brantley?

1108
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:58,485
- I'm talking to you, Howard.
- Who's Brantley?

1109
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:02,451
Brantley is the guy who just found
his stolen notes in your bag.

1110
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,660
Those are Whitfield's notes, and they
are not stolen. He gave them to me.

1111
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:10,213
You were so grateful to him, you climbed
into bed and asked him to marry you.

1112
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:12,837
What are you talking about?
I climbed into bed with you.

1113
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,166
Baloney!

1114
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,090
You thought you were
climbing into bed with her.

1115
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:19,264
Wait. When I came in,
he was in bed with Whitfield.

1116
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,467
Whitfield? He wasn't even here.

1117
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,018
- Are you blind? Who's that?
- That's Brantley.

1118
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:28,273
So this is the bimbo you've been
screwing around with at the office?

1119
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:31,646
- Who are you calling a bimbo?
- If the shoe fits...

1120
01:35:31,647 --> 01:35:33,611
What's that supposed to mean?

1121
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,905
Why didn't you ask for those?
I would have given 'em to you.

1122
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,950
I was gonna tell you about that.
It happened before I really knew you.

1123
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:43,155
So when we were in bed, that whole
thing was James Bond time, right?

1124
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:46,583
- No!
- You went to bed with Brantley?

1125
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:50,504
Don't worry, Howard. She's probably got
microfilm pictures of the whole thing.

1126
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,546
What were you doing
in bed with my nephew?

1127
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,375
- Whitfield's your nephew?
- This is Brantley Foster.

1128
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:57,210
He <i>works</i> in the mailroom.

1129
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:59,762
The mailroom?
You mean you're not an executive?

1130
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:03,759
Let me get this straight.
Brantley is Whitfield?

1131
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,218
That's right.

1132
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:08,180
Brantley is Whitfield.
Whitfield is Brantley.

1133
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:09,731
And Christy is the bimbo.

1134
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:12,688
Well, now that we've had
Mouseketeer roll call...

1135
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:15,111
I'm just going to go
call my lawyer.

1136
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:18,694
Wait. Christy is not the bimbo I was
screwing around with at the office.

1137
01:36:18,695 --> 01:36:20,488
People better stop
calling me "bimbo."

1138
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:22,284
it was an entirely different bimbo.

1139
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,034
That's fine. How many
bimbos would you say there were?

1140
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:28,496
I misspoke myself.
There weren't any bimbos at all.

1141
01:36:28,497 --> 01:36:30,960
- Except Christy.
- Right. No!

1142
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:36,007
The question is, how many people
did you sleep with to get to the top?

1143
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:42,259
That was a very expensive vase,
you bitch.

1144
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:46,226
Shut up! Now listen. Whatever I did
was my business, not yours.

1145
01:36:46,227 --> 01:36:48,891
No, you mean
it was company business.

1146
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:52,850
That's right,
and that's all it was: Business.

1147
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:00,485
Let me tell you somethin',
sweetheart.

1148
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:04,953
You're very good at your job.

1149
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:20,044
You mean I was workin'
for a guy from the mailroom?

1150
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:23,300
- You're not an executive?
- He's too good to be an executive.

1151
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:26,390
- Disappointed?
- Yes!

1152
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:29,015
I was having fun on this job.

1153
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:33,189
You had all this energy,
and all these crazy ideas.

1154
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,358
And you kept takin'
your pants off.

1155
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:37,731
I don't want you to go.

1156
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:40,563
Here.

1157
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,236
Just a little somethin'
to remember me by.

1158
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:47,279
- Thank you.
- Brantley, why you lookin' so sad?

1159
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:50,698
I don't know. I just thought
it'd work out better, you know?

1160
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:52,450
The job or the girl?

1161
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:56,500
The job. To hell with the girl.

1162
01:37:57,121 --> 01:38:00,091
Yeah.
You sound real convincing.

1163
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,256
Well, look at it this way, pal.

1164
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:08,134
For a few weeks, you sat up here in
the lofty atmosphere of the big cheeses.

1165
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:12,057
You had a nice view of Manhattan
and a clean lunchroom to eat in.

1166
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:15,936
Hell, you did more in two months
than most people do in a lifetime.

1167
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:18,935
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.

1168
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:22,480
The job or the girl?

1169
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:33,659
- Goin' back to Kansas?
- No, I'm not goin' back to Kansas.

1170
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,459
I came to New York to succeed.

1171
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:37,624
I hear there's an opening
in the mailroom.

1172
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:40,627
You should talk.
You're just as unemployed as I am.

1173
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:42,708
Not for long.
I have contacts all over town.

1174
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:45,919
- There's always another Prescott around.
- Low blow, Foster. Dirty pool.

1175
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,240
- I call 'em like I see 'em.
- Yeah, you're perfect, right?

1176
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:51,020
- I never slept with the boss.
- No, you slept with the boss's wife.

1177
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:52,469
She seduced me.

1178
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,436
He seduced me.
What's the difference?

1179
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:56,765
I couldn't help it.
You went willingly.

1180
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,727
- I see. You were tied up in chains.
- I'll tell you what the difference is.

1181
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:02,107
- I thought you were a nice guy.
- Lam a nice guy!

1182
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:03,603
You're a rat!

1183
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:05,481
You lied to me, deceived me,
then acted as judge and jury...

1184
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:07,238
in a situation
you knew nothing about.

1185
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:10,661
- I know you were spying on me.
- I wasn't spying on you!

1186
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:14,206
- And I won't be spying on you any more!
- No, you won't, 'cause if I see you...

1187
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:25,130
Sorry. This car is full.

1188
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:32,850
- We could never pull that off.
- How do you know?

1189
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:35,644
I'm a kid from the mailroom
who moved into a top executive position.

1190
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:37,559
Are you gonna tell me
I can't pull it off?

1191
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,231
But you didn't.

1192
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:43,228
I almost did.
We could pull this off.

1193
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:48,817
- I'm gonna need your help, both of you.
- Ls it somethin' I could get fired for?

1194
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,109
- Absolutely.
- I like it.

1195
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:53,954
<i>Jean,</i> see if you can find
Harley McMasters' phone number.

1196
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:56,574
And get some food up here.
Chinese sound good to you?

1197
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:01,580
Mr Davenport, we realize you'll want
to move some of your own people...

1198
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:05,417
into the medium control
positions here at Pemrose.

1199
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,132
Naturally.

1200
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:14,012
What we're concerned about, frankly,
is the upper management positions.

1201
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:20,144
- Most of'em will have to go.
- Oh, no.

1202
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:23,772
I see.

1203
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:28,231
But a handful of'em...

1204
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,655
who have been so helpful...

1205
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:35,955
like yourselves, of course...

1206
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,829
will be stayin'
as long <i>as</i> you like.

1207
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:42,419
Well, then I see nothing
to stand in the way...

1208
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:45,044
of the immediate merger
of our two companies.

1209
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:48,171
Is this the place? It is!
Hey, good. Sorry we're late.

1210
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:52,176
- Get them out of here.
- I'm sorry. This is a private meeting.

1211
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:55,805
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Hold these, will you? Thanks a lot.

1212
01:40:58,553 --> 01:41:01,352
- Call building security.
- Howard, relax. Listen.

1213
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,524
On behalf of the personnel
in the mailroom...

1214
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:06,773
the girls in the secretarial pool,
the female executives here at Pemrose...

1215
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:08,932
we wanted to give our blessing
to this little merger.

1216
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:12,784
- Who in hell are these people?
- Ls that Don? Donny!

1217
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:16,863
How ya doin'? You mind if I stand up?
I think better when I'm movin' around.

1218
01:41:16,946 --> 01:41:18,744
Gotta tell you, Don...

1219
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:20,825
at first, the idea of this merger
made me as nervous...

1220
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:23,832
as a long-tailed cat
in a room full of rocking chairs.

1221
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,209
But then I realized
I was wrong.

1222
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:29,675
The combination of our products
and your distribution capabilities...

1223
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,879
could vault Pemrose
right to the top of the market.

1224
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:36,007
So glad you approve...

1225
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:38,017
whoever you are.

1226
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,595
Now if you get the hell out of here,
we'll finish the job.

1227
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:42,972
I can't do that for you, Don.

1228
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:46,067
See, the problem here
is management.

1229
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:49,403
Things were bad enough
when Howard was running the company.

1230
01:41:49,404 --> 01:41:53,696
- Now we got you to deal with too.
- Get them out of here, now.

1231
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:57,028
He can't, Don. You see,
Brantley made arrangements...

1232
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:59,113
to buy five percent
of the stock...

1233
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:02,075
in your company,
Davenport Enterprises, this morning.

1234
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,623
- We're buying you out.
- What?

1235
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:07,501
Get in there!

1236
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:10,208
That's right!

1237
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:13,674
We've initiated a takeover
of Davenport Enterprises...

1238
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:16,552
in a proxy fight
for the Pemrose Corporation.

1239
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:20,427
- This <i>way,</i> Mr McMasters.
- Gentlemen, good afternoon.

1240
01:42:20,509 --> 01:42:22,927
These are
my financial advisers.

1241
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,977
They agreed to lend me the money
to finance this takeover.

1242
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:28,731
Surely you're not going to invest
in some crackpot scheme...

1243
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:32,192
cooked up by a kid
who used to work in our mailroom.

1244
01:42:32,193 --> 01:42:35,533
Not at first, <i>Howie,</i>
but I had an ace in the hole:

1245
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,824
A major stockholder in the company
with the clout and support I needed.

1246
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:40,997
Don, I want you to meet...

1247
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:44,121
the new chairperson
of the Pemrose Corporation...

1248
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,453
and the daughter of the founder...

1249
01:42:46,454 --> 01:42:48,295
Vera Prescott.

1250
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:53,634
Afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1251
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:55,677
Brantley and I
are very old friends...

1252
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:58,882
and when he told me his wonderful
ideas for running the company...

1253
01:42:58,964 --> 01:43:00,966
I knew he was
the man for the job.

1254
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:05,647
I think we all understand
your real motivation here, Vera.

1255
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,849
I admit I felt...

1256
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,854
some attraction towards Brantley
at the beginning...

1257
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:15,315
but <i>as</i> you've always
told me, Howard...

1258
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:17,150
love is love...

1259
01:43:17,233 --> 01:43:19,452
but business is business.

1260
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:22,780
You've run Daddy's company
into the ground, Howard...

1261
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:26,205
and I believe these people here can
bring it back to where it belongs again.

1262
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,122
Now, up, Howard,
out of that chair.

1263
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:34,216
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not about to resign my position.

1264
01:43:34,217 --> 01:43:38,088
You don't have to, Howard.
You're fired.

1265
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:39,797
What?

1266
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,842
- Vera, you can't!
- Yes, I can.

1267
01:43:43,008 --> 01:43:45,010
You see, Mr Davenport...

1268
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:49,597
as of this afternoon,
I control 50.1 %% of the voting stock.

1269
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:51,817
You, too, Art. You're history.

1270
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:59,109
Brantley, Christy,
<i>Jean,</i> Melrose.

1271
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:10,040
Gentlemen, just in time.

1272
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:12,918
Mr Prescott and his aide have
disrupted a very important meeting.

1273
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:15,091
Would you please escort them
out of the building?

1274
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:18,045
Vera! Why this open hostility?

1275
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:20,676
I don't understand.
How did you get so...

1276
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,890
Would you take charge of
the meeting <i>now,</i> Brantley?

1277
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:25,343
- What did I ever do to deserve this?
- Excuse me.

1278
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:38,405
Feel free to do that
amongst yourselves if you want.

1279
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:45,704
- So have you been to Kansas?
- No. What's in Kansas?

1280
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:49,496
Well, I figured we'd take
the private Pemrose jet...

1281
01:44:49,575 --> 01:44:51,703
drop in on the folks.

1282
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:54,038
They're gonna want to meet you.

1283
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:59,881
Why haven't I met you before?

1284
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,258
Baby, you ain't been hangin' out
in the mailroom.

1285
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:05,174
The mailroom.
I like that sound.

1286
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,773
Charlie, we got that same problem
with elevator three again.

1287
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:18,024
I don't believe this.

1288
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,565
This elevator's stuck again.

1289
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:27,014
- Where to, sir?
- The opera, Rattigan.

1290
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:29,592
Yes, sir.
